- API Gateway is a managed service from AWS which allows the creation of API Endpoints, Resources & Methods.

- The API gateway integrates with other AWS services - and can even access some without the need for dedicated compute.

- It serves as a core component of many serverless architectures using Lambda as event-driven and on-demand backing for methods.

- It can also connect to legacy monolithic applications and act as a stable API endpoint during an evolution from a monolith to microservices and potentially through to serverless.
